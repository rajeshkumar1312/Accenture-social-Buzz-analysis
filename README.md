I worked on this project by following the Accenture virtual Experience on power BI at Forage [Link here](https://www.theforage.com/fast-track/data-analytics-virtual-experience)

## Project Overview and Business Problem

I participated in the open access Accenture Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program with Forage. Where I worked as a data analyst to help an organization named “Social Buzz” to analyze their data and help them understand how they can leverage on their massive amount of data.

- Client’s Name: Social Buzz

- Client’s Industry: Social media & Content creation

## Client’s Background

- Social Buzz is a fast-growing social media organization and over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee their scaling process effectively.

- Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain.

- Up until this point, they have not relied on any third-party firms to help them get to where they are. However, one of the main reasons why they are looking to at bringing in external expertise is because, they want to learn data best practices from a large corporation. Due to the nature of their business, they have a massive amount of data so they are keen on understanding how the world’s biggest companies manage the challenges of big data.

To start our engagement with Social Buzz, we are running a 3-month initial project in order to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following:

- An audit of their big data practices
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

### Business problem

The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle its data.

### My Job Role

I am the data analyst assigned to carry out analysis on the client’s sample data sets, generate insights, prepare visualizations and prepare a presentation to the client.

### Tools used to carry out this project include

- Microsoft Excel: This was used to clean the datasets and generate key insights into the datasets.

- Microsoft Power BI: This used to carry out visualization on the insights from my analysis on Excel.

- Microsoft Power Points: I used this tool to prepare slides for presentation purposes to the client.

### During this experience I have learnt and applied my data analytics skills 

- Clean the client’s data and carry out data modeling.

- Analyze the client’s data to highlight their top 5 content categories with the largest aggregate popularity.

- Prepare data visualizations on Microsoft Power BI and carry out storytelling with data.

- Prepare a presentation to the client using Microsoft PowerPoints and sharing insights gotten from the data.

### Analysis and Insights

- Looking at the total number of posts by category we can see that the top 5 content categories are in sequential order with respect to the previous two visuals. animals top the chart with a total of 1,967 posts, followed by science which has a total of 1,864 posts. In last place is public speaking with a total post of 1,266.

- May is the month having the highest number of posts with a total of 2,138 posts, this shows that people post a lot during this period. Other high. Though there is a huge drop in total posts in the month of February with a total of 1,914 posts. From this chart we can see that posts by month undulating (rises and falls).

- In terms of percentage share of popularity amongst the top 5 content categories, animals have a popularity percentage share of 21.36%, followed by science with a popularity percentage share of 20.28%, healthy eating and food are in 3rd and 4th place respectively, with each having a popularity percentage share of 19.76% and 19% respectively.

- Most popular Reactions by score super-love has 114k , adore 111k, want 108k, cherish 105k, and love 100k.

### Recommendations

- With rise in technology it is no surprise to see contents related to technology right up with the top categories. It shows users enjoy your technology contents. I would recommend collaborating with some of the world’s tech giants as this would definitely make user engagement skyrocket.

- Animals and science are two of the most popular content categories, this shows that people enjoy “real-life” and “factual” content the most. So, I would recommend that you keep creating more contents relating to these two categories.

- Food is a common theme with the top 5 categories with “Healthy Eating” ranking as one of the highest. This may give an indication to the audience within your user base. You could use this insight to create a campaign and work with healthy eating brands to boost user engagement.
